/* Semantics of the dq_descriptor
   next points to a later descriptor. A separate descriptor is
     required when a new TS arrives or a row is skipped.
   ref_count indicates how many OCBs point to this dqd
   starting_Qrow is the index into Data_Queue.row for the first data
     row of this dqd that is still present in the Data_Queue, or the location
     of the next record if no rows are present.
   n_Qrows is the number of Qrows of this dqd still present in the
     Data_Queue, hence must be <= Data_Queue.total_Qrows.
   Qrows_expired indicates the number of Qrows belonging to this dqd
     that have been expired out of the Data_Queue
    min_reader is the number of rows in this dqd that the slowest
      reader has processed (including expired rows)
   TSq is the TS record our data is tied to
   MFCtr is the MFCtr for the starting row (possibly expired) of this
     dqd
   Row_num is the row number (0 <= Row_num < nrowminf) for the
     starting row (possibly expired) of this dqd

   n_Qrows + Qrows_expired is the total number of Qrows for this dqd
   
   To get the MFCtr and Row_Num for the current first row:
   XRow_Num = Row_Num + Qrows_expired
   NMinf = XRow_Num/tm->nrowminf
   MFCtr_start = MFCtr + NMinf
   Row_Num_start = XRow_Num % tm->nrowminf
   
   If n_Qrows == 0 and Qrows_expired == 0, MFCtr and Row_num can be
   redefined. After that, progress simply involves updating
   starting_Qrow, n_Qrows and Qrows_expired.
